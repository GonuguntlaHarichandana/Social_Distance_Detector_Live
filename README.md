Introduction:

Since the end of 2019, irresistible Covid sickness, COVID-19 has been accounted for and it has turned into a public harm wellness issue around the world. This pandemic devastatingly affects social orders and economies all over the planet causing a worldwide wellbeing emergency. Everywhere, particularly in the third wave, COVID-19 has been a critical medical services challenge. Numerous closures in various ventures have been brought about by this pandemic. Also, numerous areas, for example, support tasks and foundation development have not been suspended attributable to their huge impact on individuals' normal life.

Hence, to forestall quick COVID-19 contamination, numerous arrangements, like constrainment and lockdowns, are recommended by most of the world's state-run administrations. Nonetheless, this COVID-19 administration inefficacy can be also investigated with game-hypothetical situations past the public merchandise game. Specifically, a few analysts have zeroed in on the aversion of states to instituting troublesome yet essential infection regulation estimates like stay-at-home requests and lockdowns, as well as noncooperation because of reasons other than free riding. As individual-level choices straightforwardly affect the general public level adequacy of stay-at-home requests, states might shun carrying out them on account of expected low places of consistency, particularly from financially burdened people who don't have the advantage of remaining at home.

In outline and without failing to remember the legitimate side of AI, the profound learning strategy intrinsically addresses a full range of lawful fields. While by and by, AI is simply starting to make its mark concerning its utilization by attorneys, and inside the lawful business, legitimate researchers have been busy with AI for quite a while. Considering AI's legitimate worries and advantages in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, AI strategy-based arrangements are as yet an open window for advancement.

Motivation:

In the very first place, for almost the past 3 years we are under a COVID-19 Pandemic situation, where one is not allowed to remove a mask and is expected to follow social distancing. Monitoring and controlling every person became a tedious task. Well, in this world where we have intelligent monitoring systems based on Artificial Intelligence, why not add an extension of face mask detection and social distancing validator to the existing surveillance system? So, we came up with one of the research papers namely “Real-Time Implementation of AI-Based Face Mask Detection and Social Distancing Measuring System for COVID-19 Prevention” by Safa Teboulbi, Seifeddine Messaoud, Mohamed Ali Hajjaji, and Abdellatif Mtibaa. Where this paper talks about different applications of computer vision that can be applied to the medical field and different data sets being used to train the models also comparing the accuracy levels of the detections. Theoretically and practically, we targeted to learn something more than the classroom with this project. So when we choose this topic, we know that we will be studying more about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, more applications of Computer vision, and importantly more python libraries and working on it. We wanted to take the application of computer vision to the higher end where we can use the concepts that have been taught to us during classes and the practicals that we do regularly to apply to a particular application and using the functions according to the need of the application and building the application using various libraries, different data sets, and libraries later integrating them to work accordingly based on the need of the outcome is a very interesting job.

Work Done:

Technology Used -

OpenCV: OpenCV is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks. It is an open-source library that can be used to perform tasks like face detection, objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more.

TensorFlow: TensorFlow provides a collection of workflows to develop and train models using Python or JavaScript, and to easily deploy in the cloud, on-prem, in the browser, or on-device no matter what language you use. The tf. data API enables you to build complex input pipelines from simple, reusable pieces.

YOLO: You Only Look Once is a real-time object detection algorithm that avoids spending too much time on generating region proposals. Instead of locating objects perfectly, it prioritizes speed and recognition

KERAS: Keras is a powerful and easy-to-use free open-source Python library for developing and evaluating deep learning models. It wraps the efficient numerical computation libraries Theano and TensorFlow and allows you to define and train neural network models in just a few lines of code.

Deep learning: Deep learning utilizes both structured and unstructured data for training. Practical examples of deep learning are Virtual assistants, vision for driverless cars, money laundering, face recognition and many more.

Computer vision: Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information.

NumPy: NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed. NumPy is a Python package.

Conclusion:

Because of the desperation of controlling COVID-19, the application worth and significance of ongoing cover and social separating location are expanding. This work assessed many examinations, right off the bat, works that try to encompass the COVID-19 episode. Then, it explained the essential ideas of profound CNN models. From that point onward, this paper duplicated the preparation and testing of the most utilized profound pre-trained-put together CNN models with respect to the facial covering dataset. This embedded vision-based application can be utilized in any workspace like public spots, stations, professional workplaces, roads, shopping centers, and assessment focuses, where exactness and accuracy are profoundly wanted to fill the need. It very well may be utilized in shrewd city advancement, and it would help up the improvement interaction in many emerging nations. Our structure presents an opportunity to be more prepared for the following emergency or to assess the impacts of tremendous social change regarding sterile assurance rules.
